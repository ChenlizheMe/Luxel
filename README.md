# Luxel

**Luxel** is a real-time voxel-based ray tracing renderer built from scratch using C++ and Vulkan. It combines the efficiency of voxel data structures with the visual fidelity of ray tracing to create dynamic and interactive 3D scenes.

---

## Features

- **Voxel-Based Scene Representation**: Efficiently store and render 3D scenes using voxel grids.
- **Hardware-Accelerated Ray Tracing**: Leverage Vulkan's ray tracing extensions for real-time performance.
- **Interactive Camera**: Navigate the scene with intuitive WASD and mouse controls.
- **Temporal Accumulation**: Reduce noise through multi-frame accumulation.
- **Modular Codebase**: Clean and well-documented code for easy extension and experimentation.

## Development Environment

- **Compiler**: MSVC (Visual Studio 2022)
- **C++ Standard**: C++20
- **Graphics API**: Vulkan (with ray tracing extensions)
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 (or any Vulkan ray tracing-capable GPU)
- **Vulkan SDK**: Version 1.2.162 or later
